# Durable & Background Systems

Four systems run alongside the main conversation loop. Quick reference
here; full developer notes live in `AGENTS.md`, user-facing docs under
`website/docs/user-guide/features/`.

### Delegation (`delegate_task`)

Hermes delegates coding work to Mercury omp children, not upstream Hermes
worker agents. The live `delegate_task` schema defines supported arguments.

- Single and batch requests run children with isolated conversations.
- `background=true` returns a handle; results route back through the parent.
- Models, fallbacks, effort, and profile instructions come from the selected
  Mercury configuration and bridge.
- omp has one model role: `task`. Do not configure upstream leaf/orchestrator
  roles or assume upstream recursion/depth limits apply to this fork.
- Approval requests travel through ancestors to the user's TUI or mLounge room;
  each engine keeps its own configured approval behavior.
- Use a repository worktree per concurrent code writer. For persistent
  interactive rooms use `!spawnomp <agent> -p <profile>`; for durable schedules
  use `cronjob`. A background delegated call is not a durable cron job.

### Cron (scheduled jobs)

Durable scheduler — `cron/jobs.py` + `cron/scheduler.py`. Drive it via
the `cronjob` tool, the `mercury cron` CLI (`list`, `add`, `edit`,
`pause`, `resume`, `run`, `remove`), or the `/cron` slash command.

- **Schedules:** duration (`"30m"`, `"2h"`), "every" phrase
  (`"every monday 9am"`), 5-field cron (`"0 9 * * *"`), or ISO timestamp.
- **Per-job knobs:** `skills`, `model`/`provider` override, `script`
  (pre-run data collection; `no_agent=True` makes the script the whole
  job), `context_from` (chain job A's output into job B), `workdir`
  (run in a specific dir with its `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md` loaded),
  multi-platform delivery.
- **Invariants:** 3-minute hard interrupt per run, `.tick.lock` file
  prevents duplicate ticks across processes, cron sessions pass
  `skip_memory=True` by default, and cron deliveries are framed with a
  header/footer instead of being mirrored into the target gateway
  session (keeps role alternation intact).

### Curator (skill lifecycle)

Background maintenance for agent-created skills. Tracks usage, marks
idle skills stale, archives stale ones, keeps a pre-run tar.gz backup
so nothing is lost.

- **CLI:** `mercury curator <verb>` — `status`, `usage`, `run`, `pause`,
  `resume`, `pin`, `unpin`, `archive`, `restore`, `list-archived`, `prune`,
  `backup`, `rollback`.
- **Slash:** `/curator <subcommand>` mirrors the CLI.
- **Scope:** only touches skills with `created_by: "agent"` provenance.
  Bundled + hub-installed skills are off-limits. **Never deletes** —
  max destructive action is archive. Pinned skills are exempt from
  every auto-transition and every LLM review pass.
- **Cost:** the deterministic inactivity/prune sweep runs for free. The
  aux-model "consolidate overlapping skills into umbrellas" pass is
  **off by default** — opt in with `curator.consolidate: true` or
  `mercury curator run --consolidate`. Routine background curation costs
  zero tokens.
- **Telemetry:** sidecar at `$MERCURY_HOME/skills/.usage.json` holds
  per-skill `use_count`, `view_count`, `patch_count`,
  `last_activity_at`, `state`, `pinned`.

Config: `curator.*` (`enabled`, `interval_hours`, `min_idle_hours`,
`stale_after_days`, `archive_after_days`, `backup.*`).
